I'm a Backend-focused Developer from S√£o Paulo! ‚ú® Specialized in Node.js with a focus on TypeScript. Passionate about open-source collaboration, constantly expanding my knowledge in JavaScript (and exploring the world of TypeScript üëÄ). I also have experience in [`PHP`], [`Python`], and even ventured into the realm of [`Rust`]

- A Smile in Challenges: I approach challenges with a smile! I love diving headfirst into problems and uncharted territories, and when that doesn't work, I embark on research missions. Surprisingly, this unconventional approach to problem-solving kickstarted my journey into programming! I'm a researcher now, but only after I've explored the terrain solo
- Complexities in Dealing with Strongly Typed Languages (like [`Go`], [`Ruby`] or [`Zig`]: My relationship with certain programming languages is an intriguing journey, akin to exploring diverse realms. While I possess the capability to decipher their intricacies and grasp their inner workings, my typing pace within these languages resembles a meticulously executed spacewalk‚Äîslow and calculated. However, in the realm of languages I find myself more at ease with (like [`TypeScript`]), my typing becomes a high-speed race. It's a creative choreography that seamlessly combines comprehension and precise keystrokes, even when confronted with the intricacies of strongly typed systems!

## üìö Experience

I'm a self-taught developer primarily focused on back-end development, and it all began unexpectedly in 2020 while I was watching [`Stackz`] and [`Rato Borrachudo`] videos on how to create viruses with notepad. From that moment on, my programming journey took off! Since then, I've become a passionate back-end developer, delving into code and diving headfirst into this thrilling adventure. My beginnings may have been simple, but my passion for programming is more vibrant than ever.

### Key Notes ‚úçÔ∏è
